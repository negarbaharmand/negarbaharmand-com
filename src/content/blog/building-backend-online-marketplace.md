Today, I'd like to demonstrate the backend architecture of my Marketplace API project. This backend, designed for managing advertisements in an online marketplace, is a testament to efficient Java and Spring Boot development

## Exploring the Marketplace API

### Introduction

The Marketplace API is a testament to my growth and understanding of backend development. This API is all about managing advertisements in an online marketplace, offering users a platform to create, update, and explore various ads.. From user registration and authentication to creating and updating advertisements, the API offers a rich set of features for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

### Features

- **User Authentication and Registration:** Secure user management ensures a smooth registration process and authenticates users effectively.
- **Advertisement Creation and Management:** Users can create and manage advertisements, providing a flexible platform for showcasing their products or services.
- **Retrieval of Active Advertisements:** A powerful feature that allows users to retrieve currently active advertisements.
- **Time-Based Advertisement Retrieval:** Users can fetch advertisements from a specified number of days ago, enhancing the flexibility of the system.

## Navigating the Documentation

### API Documentation with Swagger

Exploring the capabilities of the Marketplace API using Swagger was a revelation. I could interact with endpoints, understand request/response details, and witness the API in action. It made me appreciate the importance of clear and comprehensive API documentation. To explore this documentation, do so:

1. Ensure the Marketplace API is running locally.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the Swagger UI:
   [Swagger Documentation](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

   Note: Replace `http://localhost:8080` with the actual base URL of your running API.

3. Dive into the available endpoints, review request/response details, and interact with the API directly from the Swagger UI.\

### Javadoc Documentation

The Javadoc documentation is like a map guiding through the classes, methods, and overall structure of the codebase.
